The best way to learn a new programming language is to build projects.

I have created a list of 40 beginner friendly project tutorials in Vanilla JavaScript, React, and TypeScript.

My advice for tutorials would be to watch the video, build the project, break it apart and rebuild it your own way. Experiment with adding new features or using different methods.

That will test if you have really learned the concepts or not.

You can click on any of the projects listed below to jump to that section of the article.
