Bạn dự định đến Nhật nhưng chợt nhận ra rằng mình không biết bất kỳ từ nào cả.

Hoặc bạn đang học tiếng Nhật và muốn chắc rằng bạn muốn biết những những từ nào là quan trọng nhất trong tiếng Nhật.

Đây là danh sách cho bạn.

These 100 Japanese words will get you through an untold number of situations, problems, and feelings. I'm not saying that there are not other important words out there, 
but I do think this list of 100 Japanese words will get you really, really far, if for some reason you are limiting yourself to a mere 100 words. If you want to go beyond that, 
then perhaps a resource like [WaniKani](http://wanikani.com/) is going to be a better long-term solution.

Also, if you'd like to get the most out of this list (and your trip to Japan), I highly recommend that you learn hiragana and katakana, two of the Japanese "alphabets." 
We've made a [free learn hiragana guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/), and a [free learn katakana guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/) just for such an occasion.

Let's get started.

---

### EMERGENCY
A man stabbed with a sword
First and foremost, let's learn the Japanese words that have to do with "emergency" situations. You don't want to be caught off guard in a foreign country. 
If you're in trouble, you need to be able to scream the correct words to ask for help, whether that involves finding a bathroom after you ate some bad tempura (speaking from experience here), or finding someone who can speak English (or whatever your native language is).

![dying](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2010-10-01-important-japanese-words/dying.jpg)

`トイレ (toire) = Toilet`  
Everyone poops, as the saying goes. When you gotta go, you gotta be able to ask where it's at. This word sounds almost like "toilet" without the last "t."

`手洗い (tearai) = Bathroom`  
Just like toilet, but a little more all-inclusive. You can feel free to use either of these in a pinch, though.

`助けて (tasukete) = HELP`  
Just yell this out and (maybe) someone will come to your aid…

`わかりません (wakarimasen) = I don't understand`  
Someone is speaking to you in Japanese, and they aren't using any of the hundred Japanese words you're learning now. Let them know you don't understand what they're saying with this word. Follow it up with another word on this list: "eigo!" Then they'll know you don't understand and you're asking for English.

`やめて！ (yamete!) = Stop it!`  
Maybe somebody is messing with you and you want them to stop (yakuza?). You could say this.

`英語 (eigo) = English`  
Sometimes you just need someone who speaks some English. Even though all Japanese people learn English in school, very few Japanese people are any good at speaking it. Still, it doesn't hurt to try.

`服 (fuku) = Clothes`  
Maybe you're at a hot springs and can't find your clothes. Hey, it's possible.

`死にそう (shini sou) = Seems Like I'm Going To Die`  
When things get really serious, you may need to pull out all the stops.

`警察 (keisatsu) = Police`  
If something really bad happens, these are the people you want to ask for.

`危ない (abunai) = Dangerous`  
You'll see this on signs and stuff. If someone says "abunai" to you, you should probably be careful.

`危険 (kiken) = Peril, Hazard`  
Basically, this is just another abunai. You'll see this on signs as well.

### ASKING
Asking broad general questions, then using body language to tell people the rest is a really fun way to get by in a country where you don't speak the language.

`どうした？ (doushita?) = What Happened?`  
Then again, you probably won't understand what the person responds with, but it's always nice to ask.

`どうして？ (doushite?) = Why?`  
You never know…

`なに？ (nani) = What?`  
What!? WHAT!?

![time](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2010-10-01-important-japanese-words/time.jpg)

`時間 (jikan) = Time`  
Just ask this with an quizzical tone and people will get the drift. Point to your wrist while you're at it. You might want to learn some numbers (keep reading) to understand the answer.

`質問 (shitsumon) = Question`  
Have a question? Let someone know. Couple this with "eigo! eigo!" and maybe someone who can speak some English will come to answer your shitsumon.

`だれ (dare) = Who`  
Great in case you need to know who someone's talking about.

`いつ (itsu) = When`  
Pretty important if you're trying to time something. "I know we have to meet, but when are we meeting?"

---

### PEOPLE
People are a big part of life and vocabulary. Learning Japanese words that have to do with people can be very important.

`先生 (sensei) = Teacher`  
If you're a student in Japan, this one comes in handy.

`学生 (gakusei) = Student`  
Goes with the previous Japanese word.

`会社員 (kaishain) = Employee`  
If you go to Japan to work, this is probably what you'll become.

`人 (hito) = Person`  
The general word for "person."

`私 (watashi) = I`  
For when you need to refer to yourself.

`あなた (anata) = You`  
For when you need to refer to someone else.

---

### LOCATIONS
Finding your way around can be pretty important. Here are some Japanese words that will help you do that and keep you from getting lost.

`ホテル (hoteru) = Hotel`  
You'll need to be able to find this if you're traveling in Japan.

`どこ (doko) = Where`  
Don't know where something is? Ask where it is with this word. Doko? Doko?

`空港 (kuukou) = Airport`  
Combine this with the previous word, doko, and you have kuukou doko? (Where's the airport?)

`駅 (eki) = Station`  
Trains are a huge part of traveling in Japan. Just put the name of the station before eki and you have the train station's name. For example, Tokyo Eki is "Tokyo Station."

`日本 (nihon) = Japan`  
This is the country you are going to, Japan!

`大学 (daigaku) = College`  
If you're going to Japan to study in college, this Japanese word is pretty darn important.

`本屋 (honya) = Bookstore`  
Some bookstores are pretty sketchy, be careful!

`まんが喫茶 (manga kissa) = Manga Cafe`  
These are places with computers, internet, manga, and most importantly a place to rest. These are much cheaper than hotels, and good places to stay in a pinch… that being said, they are often smoky and uncomfortable. You can usually get free fountain drinks, though!

`タクシー (takushi) = Taxi`  
Expensive, but you can find them everywhere.

`家 (uchi/ie) = Home`  
There's no place like it.

---

### FOOD
You can't find much better food than the food you can find in Japan. Even McDonalds somehow tastes better in Japan, not to mention Japanese food.

`おなかすいた (onaka suita) / はらへった (hara hetta) = Hungry`  
Two ways to say this one. First one is more neutral, second is more casual.

`食べます (tabemasu) = To Eat`  
Do you eat this? Yes I eat this. Combine it with another word, like sushi. Sushi tabemasu, with the right context, would mean "I eat sushi."

`食べません (tabemasen) = To Not Eat`  
Do you eat this? No I don't. Like tabemasu, you can combine it with another food word. Sushi tabemasen, in the right context, would mean "I do not eat sushi." Or, combine it with niku to say niku tabemasen ("I don't eat meat"). Be warned, a lot of Japanese people think fish is not meat… and it seems like almost everything has fish.

`飲みます (nomimasu) = To Drink`  
Glug Glug.

`飲みません (nomimasen) = To Not Drink`  
Beer nomimasen. I don't drink beer.

`水 (mizu) = Water`  
I drink water, instead, because that's how I roll. Mizu nomimasu.

`飲み物 (nomimono) = Drink`  
Not the verb, but the noun. Please get me a drink.

`食べ物 (tabemono) = Food`  
Need food? Any food? There's a ton of it in Japan.

`美味しい (oishii) = Good Tasting. Tasty.`  
If something tastes nice (or if you want to be nice), you'd say this.

`不味い (mazui) = Bad Tasting`  
I wouldn't ever say this to someone's face, though.

`レストラン (resutoran) = Restaurant`  
Now you need to figure out which one. There will be plenty of choices.

`コンビニ (konbini) = Convenience Store`  
Great place to buy small things and food. Convenience Store food in Japan is pretty awesome. You could eat at convenience stores for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a week and always find something new and delicious.

`スーパー (suupaa) = Super Market`  
If you need something a convenience store can't give you.

---

### BEING POLITE
You don't want to piss people off when you're in their country. When in Tokyo, as they say.

`ありがとうございます (arigatougozaimasu) = Thank You`  
Say it, a lot.

`すみません (sumimasen) = Excuse Me`  
The streets can be busy, it's nice to say excuse me when you walk through people, bump into them, or need to get by.

`ごめんなさい (gomennasai) = Sorry`  
If you bump into someone while trying to get by, you can say this.

`いただきます (itadakimasu) = Bon Apetite!`  
Actually, I don't know if that's the best translation, but it's close enough. You say this before you're about to eat, to kind of give thanks for the food you're about to devour.

`ごちそうさまでした (gochisousama deshita) = Thanks for the food`  
Another bad translation! But, there isn't really a good one. You say this after you eat, to say thanks for the food.

---

### GREETINGS
Hopefully you meet some nice people in your travels. Say hello (and then goodbye!) to them.

`おはようございます (ohayougozaimasu) = Good Morning`  
A greeting for morning.

`こんにちは (konnichiwa) = Good Afternoon`  
You can use this around noonish on to the early evening.

`こんばんは (konbanwa) = Good Evening`   
Like the other ones, but for evenings.

`ではまた (dewamata) = See You Later`  
For when you might see the other person again.

`また明日 (mata ashita) = See You Tomorrow`  
For when you'll almost certainly see them the next day.

`さようなら (sayounara) = Good bye`  
Probably won't see them for a while :(

`おやすみなさい (oyasuminasai) = Good Night`  
Time for sleepy time. Good night!

---

### BASIC VERBS
Verbs will get you a long ways. You don't have to know much else as long as you know verbs, because verbs help you to get things done. Even if you don't know the grammatical particles that go with the verbs, you can still communicate.

`行きます (ikimasu) = To Go`  
Where are you going? "Tokyo Eki. Ikimasu.," you could say, and people would understand.

`帰ります (kaerimasu) = To Return (home)`  
If you need to someone you're coming back. Will you come back to this hotel to pay your bill? Yes. Kaerimasu.

`食べます (tabemasu) = To Eat`  
Nom nom nom. (whoops, you already learned this one)

`します (shimasu) = To Do`  
This is the best verb ever. It can be used with anything. Stick it on a noun for all I care, people will understand. "Tennis shimasu," you could say. That means "do tennis" or "I do tennis."

`見ます (mimasu) = To See`  
What is it you want to see?

`買います (kaimasu) = To Buy`  
For all of you who like shopping.

`待ちます (machimasu) = To Wait`  
"I'd like you to go in there for me. I'll machimasu."

`書きます (kakimasu) = To Write`  
Have people write the directions down!

`止まります (tomarimasu) = To Stop`  
Or, if you're driving, look out for the 止 symbol on a red triangle sign. That's a stop sign.

`教えます (oshiemasu) = To Teach`  
If you're a teacher in Japan, this will come in handy. "Eigo. Oshiemasu!"

`話します (hanashimasu) To Speak`  
Combine this with eigo (English). "Eigo. Hanashimasu?" People will know that you're asking if someone speaks English.

---

### BASIC ADJECTIVES
Adjectives, while not as awesome as verbs, are also very useful. They help you describe things.

`新しい (atarashii) = New`  
No, I don't want used clothes. I want atarashii clothes.

`嬉しい (ureshii) = Happy`  
For when you eat that awesome meal… ahhh, I am so ureshii.

`大丈夫 (daijoubu) = Okay`  
Say you fall down and hit your knee. You're okay, so you can say "daijoubu!" That way people know that you're okay.

`すごい (sugoi) = Amazing`  
For the sight seeing. Listen for it in cool sightseeing spots. All the cool kids are saying it. In fact, everyone is saying it.

`高い (takai) = Expensive / Tall`  
If you're in a store and something costs a lot, you can say takai to mean "expensive." If you're talking about a building (and not planning on buying it) this word will mean "tall." It's all about context.

`大きい (ookii) = Big, Large`  
You want the big portion of food? Ookii should work.

`小さい (chiisai) = Small`  
Or, perhaps you're not a big eater, get a chiisai portion instead.

`近い (chikai) = Near`  
I'm looking for landmark XYZ. Is it chikai?

`遠い (tooi) = Far`  
Or, is XYZ landmark tooi?

`悪い (warui) = Bad`  
How do you feel? Warui. Is he a good person? No, he's warui. This word is a little bit flexible.

`いい (ii) = Good`  
There will be a lot of opportunity to use this word. Why? Because there are a lot of good things in Japan.

`面白い (Omoshiroi) = Interesting`  
There are a lot of interesting things in Japan. You'll be able to use this word a lot!

`楽しい (tanoshii) = Fun`  
And, a bunch of fun things too. Japanese rollercoasters are really tanoshii, by the way.

`熱い (atsui) = Hot`  
In the summer, Japan gets this way. If it's humid, you can say mushi atsui.

`寒い (samui) = Cold`  
In the winter, especially up north in Hokkaido, things get really samui.

`上手 (jouzu) = Good At`  
When you use your 100 Japanese words, people will tell you how jouzu your Japanese is, even though it's probably not that good.

`下手 (heta) = Bad At`  
Nobody will tell you how heta you are at Japanese.

`赤 (aka) = Red`  
Colors are good for landmarks. Doko. Aka hoteru?

`青 (ao) = Blue`  
Trees, traffic lights, and many other "green" things are considered ao in Japanese. Just a little tidbit of knowledge that might come in handy.

`黒 (kuro) = Black`  
The color of Japanese salaryman clothes.

`緑 (midori) = Green`  
For all the green things that aren't blue.

`黄色 (kiiro) = Yellow`  
I'm running out of things to say about Japanese color words.

`白 (shiro) = White`  
Now I'm really running out of things to say about Japanese color words.

`馬鹿 (baka) = Stupid!`   
I bet you already knew this one. Baka!

---

### NUMBERS
Numbers will be helpful in many situations. There are many different counters in Japanese, which are basically different ways to count different things, but basic numbers like these will work in a pinch.

`一 (ichi) = One`  
One ticket.

`二 (ni) = Two`  
Two people.

`三 (san) = Three`  
Three o'clock.

`四 (shi/yon) = Four`  
Kind of an unlucky number. Might be missing from building floors. Also, you shouldn't give gifts in sets of four.

`五 (go) = Five`  
Good way to remember the first five numbers: "Itchy knee! Son, She go!" Imagine that playing out…

`六 (roku) = Six`  
Just another number. Think of "six rocks" (roku).

`七 (shichi) = Seven`  
Also kinda unlucky, because it also contains "shi." 死, or shi means "death."

`八 (hachi) = Eight`  
The "hatch" (hachi) you have to open has a big number "eight" on it.

`九 (ku) = Nine`  
It was said that "Kublai Khan" (Ku) could only count to nine.

`十 (juu) = Ten`  
Finally, we reach ten.

`百 (hyaku) = 100`  
Jumping up an interval, the most useful coin is the 100 yen coin, aka the hyaku en coin.

`千 (sen) = 1,000`  
The first paper bill in the Japanese monetary system. These are worth about $10. There are also 2,000 and 5,000 yen bills, too.

`万 (man) = 10,000`  
Ten thousand yen bills are worth about $100.

`円 (en) = Yen.`  
Not really a number, but goes nicely with the numbers when you're talking amounts of money. ichi en, hyaku en, ichi man en, ni man en, etc.
